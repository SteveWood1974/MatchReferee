                                </ul>

                                <h2 class="mb-4 mt-5">2. Platform Use and User Conduct</h2>
                                <p>You agree to:</p>
                                <ul class="list-group list-group-flush mb-4">
                                    <li class="list-group-item">Use the Platform only for lawful purposes and in accordance with Football Association (FA) rules and guidelines.</li>

                                <h2 class="mb-4 mt-5">3. Match Booking and Confirmation Process</h2>
                                <p>The Platform facilitates connections between referees, coaches, and clubs but does not employ or directly contract any users. All arrangements are between users.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Matches are claimed on a first-come, first-served basis (post-launch).</li>
                                    <li>Double-confirmation is required to reduce no-shows.</li>
                                    <li>Cancellations must follow platform guidelines; repeated issues may lead to restrictions.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h2 class="mb-4 mt-5">4. Payments and Subscriptions</h2>
                                <ul class="list-group list-group-flush mb-4">
                                    <li class="list-group-item">Referees and coaches use the platform free of charge (initial phase).</li>
                                    <li>Clubs pay a monthly subscription (£20 inc. VAT) via Stripe for advanced features.</li>
                                    <li>All payments are processed securely by Stripe; we do not store full card details.</li>
                                    <li>Referee fees are agreed directly between users — we facilitate collection where enabled but are not responsible for disputes over payment.</li>
                                    <li>Subscriptions auto-renew; cancel anytime via the secure dashboard. No refunds for partial months.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h2 class="mb-4 mt-5">7. Indemnity</h2>
