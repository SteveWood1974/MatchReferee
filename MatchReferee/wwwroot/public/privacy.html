                                <h2 class="mb-4 mt-5">2. Children and Young People (aged 14–17)</h2>
                                <p>We allow users aged 14 and over to register, in line with Football Association (FA) rules that permit young people from age 14 to train and referee grassroots matches.</p>
                                <p>For users aged 14–17 we apply additional safeguards because the platform processes personal data and facilitates real-world match appointments:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Date of birth is mandatory at registration to confirm eligibility and apply age-appropriate controls.</li>
                                    <li>For users aged 14–15, we request a parent/guardian email during signup and send them a confirmation link to acknowledge the registration and our privacy practices. The profile remains restricted (not visible in match feeds) until this step is completed.</li>
                                    <li>Profiles for under-18s have reduced visibility: contact details are masked or in-app only until a match is confirmed with a DBS-checked coach/club.</li>
                                    <li>We process this data on the basis of **legitimate interests (facilitating safe grassroots refereeing + safeguarding)**, with consent where required for specific features (e.g. marketing).</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Our approach aligns with FA safeguarding requirements and ICO Children's Code expectations for online services likely accessed by children. Any safeguarding concerns are reported to the FA or relevant authorities.</p>

                                <!-- All remaining sections unchanged except minor references below -->

                                <h2 class="mb-4 mt-5">8. Your rights (including rights for children)</h2>
                                <p>Parents/guardians of users aged 14–17 can exercise rights on behalf of their child. Users aged 14+ also have independent rights.</p>

                                <!-- Rest of the policy (sections 4–11) remain exactly as in the previous version I provided -->

                                    <strong>Important safeguarding note:</strong> This platform involves real-world match appointments. We take child safety extremely seriously. All users aged 14–17 have restricted profile visibility and must have active parental consent. Any suspected safeguarding issue will be reported to the appropriate authorities (FA, police, local safeguarding board).
