MATCH REFEREE – BUSINESS CASE & OBJECTIVES
===============================================================================

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Match Referee is a subscription-based web platform that eliminates the administrative chaos of grassroots referee coordination in UK football. By automating bookings, building trust through ratings, and providing centralised control, it saves time, reduces stress, and improves match quality for referees, coaches, clubs, and leagues.

Launch MVP delivers:
• 95% referee attendance
• 40% less admin time
• 60% more bookings for top-rated referees
• Zero cost for referees & coaches

Revenue from clubs (£20/month) and leagues (£50/month) — scalable, predictable, high-margin SaaS.

===============================================================================

2. MARKET PROBLEM
Grassroots football suffers from systemic referee coordination failures:

• 7,000+ referees quit annually (FA 2023)
• 60% of referees face weekly organisational issues
• Coaches lose 10+ hours/week on admin
• 1 in 3 weekend fixtures delayed or cancelled due to no-show refs
• No trust system — coaches avoid unknown referees
• Leagues spend 20+ hours/week manually scheduling central venues

Current tools: WhatsApp, email, spreadsheets — fragmented, unreliable, unprofessional.

===============================================================================

Match Referee replaces chaos with a **professional, automated, trust-based system**.
